This is my final project for NNU Artificial intelligence class. I changed the way the ghosts would chase pac-man, and instead they would use a breadth-depth search to find his position. 

When you pass the first level and the ghosts get faster the game soon becomes impossible to play. I had to slow down the ghosts.

Just unzip the game and load up index.html
